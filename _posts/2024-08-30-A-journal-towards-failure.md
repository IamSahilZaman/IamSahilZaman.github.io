`30-08-2024 : 0213 T-268 days`

I tried many things, from desperately finding a _study partner_ to youtube live. But nothing seems to motivate me, well, I had motivation to study this elephantine syllabus, yet, somewhere now I'm lacking motivation, probably because I need a break - I'm planing to go Nepal, but I need to restart my study as soon as possible, so, I decided (finally) to do blogging and write the extreme minute details of my journey. I plan to make this post **one-stop-for-all**, hence will be a very long post. I will update each day and time. with details what I'm going to do. 

Before that I need to first check my current status. What's done? What's left.

## What's done (done huh!) ?  

GS1 : 
* Indian culture will cover the salient aspects of Art Forms, literature and Architecture from 
ancient to modern times. 
* Modern Indian history from about the middle of the eighteenth century until the present￾ significant events, personalities, issues. 
* The Freedom Struggle — its various stages and important contributors/contributions from 
different parts of the country. 
* Post-independence consolidation and reorganization within the country. 
* History of the world will include events from 18th century such as industrial revolution, 
world wars, redrawal of national boundaries, colonization, decolonization, political 
philosophies like communism, capitalism, socialism etc.— their forms and effect on the 
society. 
* ~~Salient features of Indian Society, Diversity of India.~~
* ~~Role of women and women’s organization, population and associated issues, poverty and developmental issues, urbanization, their problems and their remedies.~~
* ~~Effects of globalization on Indian society.~~

* ~~Salient features of world’s physical geography.~~
* Distribution of key natural resources across the world (including South Asia and the Indian 
sub-continent); factors responsible for the location of primary, secondary, and tertiary 
sector industries in various parts of the world (including India). 
* ~~Important Geophysical phenomena such as earthquakes, Tsunami, Volcanic activity, cyclone 
etc.~~, geographical features and their location-changes in critical geographical features (including water-bodies and ice-caps) and in flora and fauna and the effects of such changes.

My entire history portion is left, and my Indian Geography is left. So, in next month, will complete **Ancient & Medieval History with Art & Culture**. But, I need to do something else also. Lets see GS2.

* Indian Constitution—historical underpinnings, evolution, features, amendments, significant provisions and basic structure. 
* Functions and responsibilities of the Union and the States, issues and challenges pertaining to the federal structure, devolution of powers and finances up to local levels and challenges therein.

* Structure, organization and functioning of the Executive and the Judiciary—Ministries and Departments of the Government; pressure groups and formal/informal associations and their role in the Polity.
* Salient features of the Representation of People’s Act. 
* Appointment to various Constitutional posts, powers, functions and responsibilities of various Constitutional Bodies. 
* Statutory, regulatory and various quasi-judicial bodies. 
* Government policies and interventions for development in various sectors and issues arising out of their design and implementation.

* Role of civil services in a democracy. 
* **India and its neighborhood- relations.
* **Bilateral, regional and global groupings and agreements involving India and/or affecting India’s interests. 
* **Effect of policies and politics of developed and developing countries on India’s interests, Indian diaspora. 
* **Important International institutions, agencies and fora- their structure, mandate**

For, GS2, I'm in dilemma, it seems like I haven't read polity, no matter what, but, I guess, I should prioritise completing syllabus first. **International Relation** it is! But, I will only do, till my coaching does, _yes, I'm enrolled in coaching, that take tests too, but I don't give any._

So,
